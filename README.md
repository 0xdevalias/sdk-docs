# Beeper SDKs

This repo contains instructions for various SDKs that can be used with Beeper.

## Widgets

Beeper Widgets are React-based webpages displayed on the sidebar of Beeper's desktop app, and are able to interact with the data inside a chat. 

See [Widgets.md](Widgets.md) for instructions on how to make a widget.

## Bridges

In addition to Beeper's bridges, which connect to your chat networks, you can self-host bridges as well. You can self-host a bridge of your choice, or one of the open-source Beeper-maintained bridges.

Use https://github.com/beeper/bridge-manager to self-host a bridge.

## Bots

You can create Matrix bots that people can interact with, using the package https://github.com/maubot/maubot.
